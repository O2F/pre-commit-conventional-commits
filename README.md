# pre-commit-conventional-commits

This is a very basic pre-commit hook to ensure your commit messages conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

To enable this for your repo, install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) and run `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
